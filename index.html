Heya Heya,
Username: Travotavo#4301
I'm a coder and a 3d modeler and as much as it pains me to say I cannot work for free (especially for that 3d modeling part)
In general, prices will be as follows (open to discussion based on scope and complexity):
Coding: 5-15$ via paypal or venmo
     1.   I work most comfortably in Psych and Kade Engine source, do not ask me to use lua
     2. The 5 dollar range includes dumping all your assets into the engine, lining up offsets, and special notes
     3. Things such as game changing mechanics, UI Overhauls, Basically anything shown below, falls into the 10 dollar range
     4. For additional mechanics or gameplay elements, be aware that I will usually ask a lot of questions in order to implement it correctly
3D Modeling (Includes 5 animations and a rendered spritesheet): 40$ via paypal or venmo (30$ for flat textures)
     1.  These will be fully rigged, textured and animated models, I will also send you the .blend file if you wish
     2. You must provide some sort of reference for the character, as well as heavy description for the idle and poses
     3. I can do additional animations for 5$ a pop
     4. Backgrounds will be priced on a case by case basis.
